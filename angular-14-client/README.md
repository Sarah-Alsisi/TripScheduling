# Angular 14 example project: CRUD with Rest API
Build an Angular 14 CRUD App example to consume Rest APIs, display, modify & search data.

Station Application in that:
- Each Station has id, name.
- We can retrieve, update, delete Stations.
- Creating Station can only be accessed through backend.
- There is a Search bar for finding Station by id.

Run `c` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Run Angular application
```
npm install
ng serve --port 8081
```
